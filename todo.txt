Foreign Key: you can't insert a record that references non-existing row
- So it checks every time I insert something



Insert:

INSERT INTO <table name> (columns)
VALUES (values);

Update:
UPDATE <table name> SET <column name> = <value> WHERE ...

Delete:
DELETE FROM <table name> WHERE ...



Create Table
Alter Table
Drop Table

Auto-increment
Sequence

When using auto-increment or sequence TRY to insert null and see what happens



CHECK may foreign key be NULL!!!!!
